It is simple Next JS application focused on building components, and simple authentication for E-Com application.

## Stack used in this Projects:

-[NextJs](https://nextjs.org/)
    -[ReactJs](https://react.dev/)
-[TailwindCss](https://tailwindui.com/)
-[tRPC](https://trpc.io/)

## Experience in this Project

As per my knowledge, NextJs is completely focused on Server side rendering, if we need high performance with less user
interaction web application NextJs is the perfect hub to build stuff.
tRPC would be the next game changer for full-stack application. Performance and type safe makes tRPC the best choice.
